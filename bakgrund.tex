\section{Background}
The dynamic range compressor is a complex nonlinear time dependent system where the the amplitude peaks of a signal is suppressed, reducing its dynamic range. The complexity of the system together with the vast set of design choices makes it difficult to draw a generic block diagram of the process\cite{giannoullis}  and thus we will, in the analysis, focus on a digital implementation corresponding to the ideal components of it's analogue counterpart.\bibliographystyle{plain}.
