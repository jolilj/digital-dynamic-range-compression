\subsection{Implementation} \label{method_implementation}
The compressors were implemented and tested in MATLAB. The parameter optimisation was conducted using the built in function \emph{fminsearch}\footnote{For documentation see \cite{fminsearch}} which uses the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm. 

The code for the implemented DDRC's is available in appendix ~\ref{appendix_code}.
%\subsubsection{Peak Detection}
%As discussed in section \ref{dynamic_range}, the level detection stage is of great importance in constructing a DDRC motivating an evaluation of the various level detectors separated from the rest of the side-chain, as done in \cite{reiss2012tutorial}. The following detectors were tested with and without upsampled signal:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item{Analog Peak Detector} 
%\item{Branching Smooth Peak Detector}
%\item{Decoupled Smooth Peak Detector}
%\item{Windowed Peak Max Detector}
%\item{Windowed Peak Max Filtered Detector}
%\end{itemize}
%Results show, see section \ref{results} that the optimised parameters of the branching smooth and analog peak detector indicate instant attack, $\tau_a = 0$. These detectors were thus implemented and tested with instant attack.
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item{Analog Instant Attack Peak Detector}
%\item{Smooth Instant Attack Peak Detector}
%\end{itemize}

%\subsubsection{RMS Detection}

%\subsubsection{Gain Smoothing}
%The gain smoothing stage is considered to be used mainly for artistic purposes where the end user can tweak the attack/release parameters to achieve the preferred sound. The filters used for gain smoothing are for this reason not tested separately, although a few of them are the same filters as in the level detection, see especially \cite{reiss2012tutorial}.
%\subsubsection{DDRC Design}
%The following designs that have been recommended in previous work were tested, without upsampling:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item{\cite{mcnally1984dynamic} Analog peak detection and branching smooth gain}
%\item{\cite{dafx11} Branching peak detection and branching smooth gain}
%\item{\cite{reiss2012tutorial} Full rectification peak detection and branching smooth gain}
%\item{\cite{reiss2012tutorial} Full rectification peak detection and decoupled smooth gain}
%\item{\cite{frindle1996implementation} Upsampled peak detector and linear hold smooth gain}
%\end{itemize}
%Together with the following DDRC designed based on the results:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item{Upsampling}
%\item{Windowed filtered max peak detector??}
%\item{Branching gain smoothing??}
%\end{itemize}
