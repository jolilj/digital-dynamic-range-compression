\subsubsection{Time Constants}\label{appendix_time_constants}
The time constants, denoted by $\tau$ with various subscripts depending on purpose, can be seen as a measure of the reaction time of the compressor. There are various ways of defining them. In \cite{mcnally1984dynamic} the attack time is defined as the time it takes to achieve 63.2\% of the final change in gain in accordance with the conventional notion. The same applies to the release time such as the time it takes for the output to reach 63.2\% of the input value as it has decreased below the threshold level. The definitions can be understood by noting that with exponential characteristics

\begin{align}
1-e^{-t / \tau}\rvert_{t=\tau} = 1-e^{-1} \approx 63.2\% \label{eq:time_const}
