\subsection{RMS Detector Evaluation}\label{discussion_rms}
The evaluation of the RMS Detector uses as ideal case the envelope divided by the crest factor. However, in here lies an ambiguity. The RMS is by definition the \emph{average} of the signal over a \emph{specified} time. That the signal has a well defined envelope \emph{does not} imply that the RMS of the signal should track that envelope as in the peak detection case. This makes the evaluation of the RMS detectors restricted to the case where the \emph{specified} time scale is of order $\sim T_c$ where $T_c$ is the period of the carrier frequency.
