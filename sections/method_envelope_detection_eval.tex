\subsection{Envelope Detection} \label{method_env_det}
The level detection and smoothing techniques used is what in essence separates the various compressors from each other. 

As there are various designs placing an envelope detector in the beginning of the side-chain an evaluation of these is of interest. The comparison conducted in \cite{reiss2012tutorial} do shed light on the different characteristics but misses the fact that these differences tend to diminish as the parameters of one compressor is optimized to match that of an other. Furthermore there is little discussion regarding introduced harmonics due to nonlinearites.
