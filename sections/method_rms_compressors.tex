\subsection{Discarding Evaluation of RMS Level Compressors}\label{method_rms_compressors}
A possible ideal case for the RMS is the ideal envelope divided by the crest factor. However, in here lies an ambiguity. The RMS is by definition the \emph{average} of the signal over a \emph{specified} time. That the signal has a well defined envelope \emph{does not} imply that the RMS of the signal should track that envelope as in the peak detection case. 
This makes it difficult to define ideal compression in the RMS detection case and the evaluation of RMS compressors are therefore left for future work.
