\subsection{Topologies}
There are two possible topologies for implementing a DDRC; a feed-forward or a feedback system. In \cite{reiss2012tutorial} it is shown that the feedback topology cannot implement a look-ahead delay and cannot work as a perfect limiter why, in this thesis, only variations of the feed-forward topology are treated. A generic feed-forward DDRC, applicable on all designs known to the authors, can be viewed in the block diagram of Fig. ~\ref{fig:block_genericDDRC}.
