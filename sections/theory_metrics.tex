\subsection{Metrics}\label{theory_metrics}

% ============================
\subsubsection{Fidelity of Envelope Shape} \label{fes}
In~\cite{stone2007quantifying} Fidelity of Envelope Shape (FES) is proposed as a metric of the correlation between the envelope shape before and after compression. It is further used in the design comparison conducted in ~\cite{reiss2012tutorial}.

FES is defined as the correlation between the input signal envelope $E_n$ and the output signal envelope $O_n$ using the Pearson correlation coefficient: \begin{equation}
\FES = \dfrac{\sum(E_n - \overline{E}_n)(O_n - \overline{O}_n)}{\sqrt{\sum(E_n - \overline{E}_n )^2}\sqrt{\sum(O_n - \overline{O}_n )^2}},
\end{equation}
where $\overline{E}_n$ and $\overline{O}_n$ denote the mean value of $E_n$ and $O_n$ respectively.

% ============================
\subsubsection{Total Harmonic Distortion}
A common measure of nonlinearity of a system is the \emph{total harmonic distortion} defined as \cite{shmilovitz2005definition}
\begin{align}
\THDF = \dfrac{\sqrt{a_2^2 + a_3^2 + ... + a_N^2}}{a_1}
\end{align}
which is the square root the ratio of the sum of powers of all harmonic frequencies above the fundamental frequency to the fundamental frequency.

% ============================
\subsubsection{Effective Compression Ratio}
A metric used in \cite{stone1992syllabic} is the \emph{effective compression ratio} defined as
\begin{align}
\ECR = \dfrac{S_\text{I}}{S_\text{O}}
\end{align}
where $S_\text{I}$ and $S_\text{O}$ is the input  and output dynamic range, respectively.

% ============================
\subsubsection{Euclidean Norm}
In \cite{bitzer2006parameter} the euclidean norm, or normalised euclidean distance, is used to measure the difference between two signals, $x_n$ and $y_n$, of equal length. It is defined as
\begin{align}
\EN = ||x-y|| = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}(x_n-y_n)^2}
\end{align}
where $N$ is the length of the signals in samples.
