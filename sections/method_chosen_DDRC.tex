\subsection{Chosen DDRCs} \label{method_chosen_DDRC}
\subsubsection{McN84 Peak Detection}
The design proposed in \cite{mcnally1984dynamic} consists of either a peak or RMS level detector. In this study the peak detector is used. Since this algorithm is presented in both \cite{zolzer2008digital} and \cite{dafx11} it is the first DDRC to be evaluated.  The design is summarised in Table~\ref{tab:mcn84}.
\begin{table}[h]

\label{tab:mcn84}
\begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
	\hline
	Component & Type \\ \hline
	Peak detection & Analog peak detector, Eq.~\eqref{eq:analog_det} \\
	Gain computer & Standard, Hard knee, $W=0$, Eq.~\eqref{eq:gain} \\
	Gain smoothing & Linear branching. Eq.~\eqref{eq:mcnally_gain_smoothing} \\
	\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}
\subsubsection{FE96}
In \cite{frindl1996dynamic} an interesting design is proposed. Since this is the only publication mentioning upsampling as a method for reducing distortion and oscillating errors it is chosen as the second DDRC for evaluation. A summary of the design is seen in Table~\ref{tab:fe96}.

	Gain computer & Standard. Soft knee, $W\geq0$. Eq.~\eqref{eq:gain} \\
	Gain smoothing & Linear in log domain. Eq.~\eqref{eq:frindle_gainsmooth} \\

\subsubsection{GMR12 Smooth Branching and Smooth Decoupled Peak}
The scientific comparison and tutorial of DDRC design conducted in \cite{reiss2012tutorial} resulted in the recommendation of two peak detecting compressors summarised in Table~\ref{tab:gmr12_decoupled} and~\ref{tab:gmr12_branching}. Since these are the latest proposed designs, they were chosen as the third and fourth tested DDRCs.
