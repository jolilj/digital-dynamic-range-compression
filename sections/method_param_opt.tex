\subsection{Parameter Optimisation}\label{method_param_opt}
In \cite{reiss2012tutorial} the placement, type and domain of the level detector is partly motivated by comparing step and down-step response of the compressors with equal parameter settings. The fact that various algorithms exhibit different characteristics with equal parameters does however bias the result. 

Two compressor designs presented in \cite{reiss2012} are examined
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
 \item Full wave rectification with smooth branching log domain gain smoothing (recommended)
\item  Branching peak detector without gain smoothing (not recommended)
\end{enumerate}
First, a step and down-step response with equal parameter settings are generated. Second, the same step and down-step response is generated but with the parameter  settings of the second compressor being optimised using the euclidean distance to the output of the first compressor as cost function.
