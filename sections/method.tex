\section{Method}\label{method}
A thorough study of a variety of DDRC's presented in literature has been made and their components described. Due to time and computational limits a selection of the described variants had to be made. Given the large number of peak and RMS detectors combined with the various gain smoothing filters a vast amount of design configurations are possible. To narrow the scope of the study, four algorithms were evaluated and compared. The parameter settings were optimised for a specific test signal to achieve a measure of how close to ideal the chosen DDRC performs.  In this section the chosen DDRCs are presented and the evaluation method described.
