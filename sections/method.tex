\section{Method}
In order to develop a method for comparing DDRC designs, a definition of ideal compression is needed. Furthermore a discussion of the metrics used in previous comparisons \cite{reiss2012tutorial} is required. In this section these subjects are treated and the method used in the comparison of both full DDRC designs and the filters used for level detection and smoothing is described.
